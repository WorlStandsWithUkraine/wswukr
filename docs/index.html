    <h3>
        On <b>February, 24th</b> its whole territory was attacked by <b style="color: blue">Russian</b> armed forces - from the territories of
        <b style="color: red">Russia and Belarus</b>, from the sea, and the sky.
         They are deploying paratroopers, carrying out air strikes and shoot at us from across the border.
        
        The war between Ukraine and Russia is the incredible suffering of thousands of innocent people. They kill women and children; a lot of civilians were taken hostage. 
        The Kremlin is bombing the cities of our country, destroying strategic facilities, schools, hospitals, maternity hospitals, high-rise buildings, and our homes. 
    </h3>
    
    <h3>
        Thanks to the <b>Army</b> and the unity of <b style="color: deepskyblue; background: gray">Ukrai</b><b style="color: yellow; background: gray">nians</b>, we are standing strong but need all the help we can get.
