    <h3>
        On <b>February 24th</b>, <b>Ukraine</b> was attacked by <b>Russian</b> armed forces - from the land, sea and sky.
        They are deploying paratroopers, carrying out air strikes and shoot at us from across the border.
        The war between Ukraine and Russia is the incredible suffering of thousands of innocent people. They kill women and children; a lot of civilians were taken hostage. 
        The Kremlin is bombing the cities of our country, destroying strategic facilities, schools, hospitals, maternity hospitals, high-rise buildings and our homes. 
    </h3>
    
    <h3>
        Millions of people were forced to flee their homes for own safety and seek for shelters.  
        Many families have lost everything and need support and protection.
    </h3>
    <h3>
        Thanks to the <b>Army</b> and the unity of <b>Ukrainians</b>, we are standing strong but need all the help we can get.
    </h3> 
     <h3>
         Our charity organization supports Ukrainian people from inside. We are trying to be right there where the help needed the most. <b>Help us to
  continue our mission.</b>
    </h3>
